<p>
    We’ve always done things a little differently at Centric Consulting.
    We didn’t start in a conference room. Instead, we started on a couch. And we’ve grown our business on a set of three building blocks:
    <br /> 
    <br />  
    Enjoy the people you work with, have fun, and do great work.
    <br /> 
    <br />  
    Not only do these blocks serve as our model for consulting, but they’ve created a culture that values team unity and collaboration. We enjoy working together, alongside you, to create personalized solutions for your business.
